# Pine3D-HD
Most efficient 3d graphics library for CraftOS-PC, now in HD!

Run the modernized installer: `wget run https://pastebin.com/raw/EJYMFXUe`

## THIS IS A WIP!
Most problems with being ported to CraftOS-PC's graphics mode are fixed, but stability is not guaranteed.

## Documentation
Pine3D-HD adds support for `.scm` compressed modules.
```
 -- pineapple at 0, 0, 0
ThreeDFrame:newCompressedObject("models/pineapple.scm", 0, 0, 0)
```
All standard Pine3D models have their `.scm` file also included in Pine3D-HD. You must use `newCompressedObject` to import them.

See [the pinepack repo](https://github.com/SpartanSf/pinepack) for information on the `.scm` format.

The rest of the documentation can be found on https://pine3d.cc/ .
